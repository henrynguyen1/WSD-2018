        <title>Social Issues in Diagnosis </title>
        <author>Annemarie Goldstein Jutel, Kevin Dew</author>

            <abstract>
                Diagnosis, the classification tool of medicine, serves an 
                important social role. It confers social status on those who 
                diagnose, and it impacts the social status of those diagnosed. 
                Studying diagnosis from a sociological perspective offers 
                clinicians and students a rich and sometimes provocative view 
                of medicine and the cultures in which it is practiced. Social 
                Issues in Diagnosis describes how diagnostic labels and the 
                process of diagnosis are anchored in groups and structures as 
                much as they are in the interactions between patient and doctor.
